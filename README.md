First steps

Hello everyone!
I'm Tom, I like Taco Tuesdays and coffee. Like to play sports as it's the only acceptable way to run around outside as an adult.
Also have become mildly addicted to games since being legally locked inside.
It's not the worst addiction tbf.
This might even be my 3rd pull request!
